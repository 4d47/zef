=head2 Zef

Perl6 Module Management

=for HTML <a href="https://travis-ci.org/ugexe/zef"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/ugexe/zef.svg?branch=master"></a>

=head1 Installation

=head4 Rakudobrew

To install it via rakudobrew, please use the following command:

    $ rakudobrew build-zef

=head4 Manual

    git clone https://github.com/ugexe/zef.git
    cd zef
    perl6 -Ilib bin/zef install .

=head1 USAGE

    # duh
    zef install CSV::Parser

    # search for module names matching `CSV::Parser`
    zef search CSV::Parser

    # test project in current directory    
    zef test .

    # fetch a specific module only
    zef get CSV::Parser

=head2 Notice

Still Beta level software. The process of implementing all of the previous features, test suite, and documentation is
still in the works (see an older readme to see expected full feature set).

It will even generate a build hook from convoluted Build.pm hook files to not require an external dependency on a package
manager (It does this via saving as a file named Build.pm.zef (a valid Build.pm file the panda can understand if renamed back)
that gets deleted affterwards.

=head2 More CLI

=head4 B<install>
    
    # skip testing
    --skip-tests

    # install the requested modules regardless of currently installed versions
    --force

=head4 B<search>

How these are handled depends on the `ContentStorage` engine used, which by default is the p6c ecosystem and
metacpan. Note that metacpan search is not likely to produce any useful results yet. More documentation will
be available when I have a better idea how to integrate results from these 2 services.

=head2 Plugins and Configuration

See the root zef directory for config.json. Each phase module will attempt to load/use each plugin in order.
More details to be made available in time, but they are fairly simple and the code itself should provide enough
insight to get something done.

See the configuration file in L<resources/config.json|https://github.com/ugexe/zef/blob/master/resources/config.json> for a little more information on how plugins are invoked.

=head1 FAQ

=head3 CPAN?

The functionality is mostly there. The API to search and find a specific module needs more work, but currently can execute
a query and takes the first matching distribution name. It can also download, extract, and install as well. Other than
polishing up the search API access it needs metacpan itself to host Perl6 distributions (not interested in the PSIXDIST
author hackery).
